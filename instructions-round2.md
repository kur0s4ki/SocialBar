here we introduce a new way of turning on leds , instead of turning them on at once , we will be doing something like a snake effect , we have 4 green big hole , we will turn on 3 at a time then slide in the direction of the clock giving the effect of a snake moving
we turn on (1,2,3,4) in green , 
the leds in my front end are organized as follows :
1 2
3 4
thus if we start with 1 2 4 , next we ill have 2 4 3 then 4 3 1 then 3 1 2 then back to 1 2 4 , with a 3 sec duration per change.
and (5,6,7,8) in red , and bonus section in yellow (9,10,11,12,13)
